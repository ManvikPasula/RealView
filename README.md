# RealView
Code used for the RealView project, and intelligent wearable aid for the visually impaired.

The main script that runs all functionalities (depth, guidance, and perception) linked together via wake-word is situated in "full.py".

Each of the subdirectories for each individual functionality contains a collection of scripts that I used when developing that functionality.

These were all run on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.
